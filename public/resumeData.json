After a lot of soul-searching, I discovered I love teaching and enabling others to do their best, but teaching in a school environment was not for me. I focused my studies onto English Cultural and Literary studies, as well as Linguistics. Being able to speak 2 languages has helped me approach problems from two different angles, as I found that structually you process issues differently in different languages."
